					<h1>About Me</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="mainContent">
					<p>	My background is basically full Australian with a little bit of English on my grandfather’s side therefore I only speak English, I have only completed high school and this is the first post high school education I have done, I have played many sports over the years including; Football, soccer, basketball, baseball, cricket, golf, athletics, softball and swimming although I’m not great at swimming. One slightly interesting fact about me is that across all those sports I have only ever won one grand final (softball for school) and have lost 11.</p>

					<h1>My Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="mainContent">
					<p> My interest in IT is cyber security, learning about all the specifications of how companies protect themselves online and how VPN’s and online safety woks. My interest in this came from my father who is one of the heads of cyber security at the BOM in Melbourne and I found his work interesting. I’ve learned the very basics in high school such as routers switches, networks and things like that but want to learn more advanced things. I chose RMIT because firstly my brother goes here and so did my father, RMIT also had the best opportunity for me through OU. I expect to learn the ins and outs of computer software and hardware.

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="mainContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p> Many farmers in remote and rural locations suffer from theft of farm machinery from their large sheds and barns due to lack of physical security services and inadequate surveillance capabilities. My proposal is to design and build a drone-based surveillance capability which will notify or alert a farmer if it detects movement of people or equipment within their storage facilities.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>Theft of farm equipment and machinery causes huge financial losses for famers all around the country. Machines like tractors and ploughs are very expensive and can disrupt farming and production when taken, especially when theft occurs during critical periods. Using my product would help prevent many thefts from occurring at a relatively low cost and with little supervision required.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p> My proposal will enable a farmer to utilize a low-cost drone within a large farm or storage shed which will regularly patrol the area with its camera attached. The drone would start on a charger and be programmed to take flight on auto pilot and follow a route pre made, the drone would lift off every hour/ half an hour and do a patrol with either a built in thermal camera to see any irregularities or maybe a motion tracker to see if equipment or people move around and then if it were to find anything it would fire off an SMS to the farmer through a built in sim card. The farm shed would need to have markers placed inside it and all around the machinery storage areas so that the drone can scan that area. The drone would finish its path by landing back on the charger waiting for the program to tell it to go again. If the farm/ farmer has no sort of 4G or wireless connection to send the sms to their phone then we could possibly rig the drone to fly all the way to the door and ring the doorbell, when the person clicks a button the drone would then return to the charger. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>In order for this project to run we would need a drone with a charger, as well as a raspberry pi that could hold a sim card or a usb that could hold a sim and go in the raspberry pi, as well as UAV GCP markes for the drone to navigate through also if the door bells option is used then a rod to push the door bell.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>In order to make the drone fly the way its supposed to then i would need the knowledge on how they fly, also on how to put the drone together, but mostly i would need to learn python in order to program the drone to move around and on a timer and find all the spots it needs to be in.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p> Getting this drone to work would mean that farmers need to worry less about their crops getting stolen as well as farmers would save money by not having to replace stolen goods.</p>
